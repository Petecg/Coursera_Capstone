<H1>Introduction / Business Problem</H1>
In Mexico the census of the whole population is taken **every 10 years** (as in the US), and according to the gathered information some classifications
are created based on the numbers obtained, one of those classifications is the *ambit of an area, those could be rural or urban* (depending on the
population of each area).
<br>
Given that the census is taken every 10 years, the conditions of the population change and some areas classified as rural could be on the **verge of becoming an urban areas.**
<br>
*As an area transits from rural to urban the services needed differ* and knowing which areas are on this process of urbanization is helpful to
service providers and government institutes in order to provide the necessary services to this areas.
<br>
For this project I will be using the information from Mexico. The country is divided into states, each states has municipalities and each municipality
has neighborhoods. The information gathered is from the Toluca municipality, located inside the State of Mexico; one of the biggest states in Mexico in terms
of population and economic activity.
