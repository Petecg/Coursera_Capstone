# Data
In this project I will use the data available from the National Institute of Information,  Stadistics and Georaphy (INEGI for its initials in Spanish).
The institute provides a repository with geographic information regarding the neighborhoods of each municipality which contains the ambit (rural or urban)
as well as the coordinates (latitude and londigutde) of each neighboorhood.
As requested in the project the information about venues will be consulted using Foursquare API.
